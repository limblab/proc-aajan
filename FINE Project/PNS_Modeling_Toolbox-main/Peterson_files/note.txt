These thresholds and weights are the extended version

Pulsewidths = [0.005,0.01,0.015,0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2];
%Pulsewidths = [0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2] ; % matching old data

% create a matrix of nodal voltages for evenly spaced set of amplitude and
% d2ve data. Take into account d2ve cannot exceed 2*A -> divide by zero
A_grid  = [0:25:1500]; % shift by 1 to avoid divide by zero
d2Ve_grid = [0:5:1500];
