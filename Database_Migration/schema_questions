
1) The following fields are in the DAYS table and in the SESSIONS table:
- num_reward
- num_abort
- num_fail
- num_incomplete
- behavior_notes
- behavior_quality

Should we keep these in the sessions table only? Is behavior quality by day the same as behavior quality by session?

------------------------------------

2) The following field exists in SESSIONS and THRESHOLD_FILES:
- num_chans (THRESHOLD_FILES), numChannels (SESSIONS)

Is there a reason to keep both?

------------------------------------

3) EMG_FILES, FORCE_FILES, and KIN_FILES all have the following structure:
- filename (unique key)
- file_id (primary)
- sessions_key 
- paper_key
- rec_system (FORCE_FILES and EMG_FILES)
- sampling_rate
- table-specific fields - e.g. force_quality, emg_quality, kin_quality, force_notes, emg_notes, kin_notes, etc...

Can we combine all these data into a single "files" table? are the filenames/fileids the same for each one?
